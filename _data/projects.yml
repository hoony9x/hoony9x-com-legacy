    To deal with the problem using handwritten order sheet, I decided to make this system. <br/><br/>

    I first developed this system on a web-based basis using PHP and MySQL in 2014,<br/>and I am taking advantage of the system at the pub every festive season every year.<br/><br/>

    In 2016, I developed a 2nd version using Node.JS (with ExpressJS) and AngularJS.<br/>
    And the 3rd version was developed in 2017, using Python3 (with Flask) and React.<br/><br/>

    The 4th version is under development right now.
